# mzQC Visualizer

A modern web application for visualizing and analyzing mzQC (Mass Spectrometry Quality Control) files. Built with Streamlit and Python, this tool provides an intuitive interface for exploring quality metrics from mass spectrometry experiments.

> **Note**: This is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) developed as part of the Google Summer of Code 2025 project for OpenMS. The project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for visualizing mzQC files, with future enhancements planned based on community feedback.

## Features

- ðŸ“Š **Interactive Visualization**: Dynamic charts and graphs for numeric metrics using Altair
- ðŸ”„ **Run Comparison**: Compare metrics across multiple runs in a single view
- ðŸ“‹ **Detailed Metrics View**: Categorized display of numeric, list, and other metrics
- ðŸ“‘ **Report Generation**: Export detailed HTML reports for both single runs and comparisons
- âœ… **Schema Validation**: Automatic validation against the official mzQC JSON schema
- ðŸ“ˆ **Responsive Design**: Modern, user-friendly interface that adapts to your data

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mzqc-visualizer-mvp.git
cd mzqc-visualizer-mvp
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Start the application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (typically http://localhost:8501)

3. Upload your mzQC file using the file uploader

4. Explore your data:
   - View run metadata and quality metrics
   - Toggle comparison mode for multiple runs
   - Generate and download reports
   - Visualize metrics with interactive charts

### Example Files

To try out the application, you can use these example mzQC files from the HUPO-PSI repository:

1. **Single Run Example** ([intro_run.mzQC](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/blob/main/specification_documents/examples/intro_run.mzQC))
   - Basic example with a single mass spectrometry run
   - Contains MS1/MS2 spectra counts and acquisition ranges
   - Good for testing basic visualization features

2. **QC2 Sample Example** ([intro_qc2.mzQC](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/blob/main/specification_documents/examples/intro_qc2.mzQC))
   - Contains detailed QC2 sample measurements
   - Includes mass accuracies and intensities for specific peptides
   - Demonstrates complex metric visualization

3. **Batch Comparison Example** ([metabo-batches.mzQC](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/blob/main/specification_documents/examples/metabo-batches.mzQC))
   - Multiple batch runs for comparison
   - Ideal for testing the comparison mode
   - Shows batch-to-batch variations

To use these examples:
1. Download the raw content of any example file
2. Save it with a `.mzQC` extension
3. Upload it to the application
